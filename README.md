# Jira-BI-Project
Jira-BI-project was a project proposed by Talys under agreement with Esprit university. </br>
Talys is a company that work with Jira software but they were highly unsatisfied with the reports on jira's dashboards.</br>
We used Talend, PostgreSQL and Power BI to create a better dashboard to respond to their needs. </br>
PS: This was a group prject done under the supervision of experienced teachers and Data analysts. </br>
Project Description: </br>

The company provided us with a database they extracted from the Jira data they have. </br>
The database was a PostgreSQL database. </br>
Sadly for us, it had a 360 Tables! but in according with the list of objectives we set out from the start we managed to eliminate what we didn't need and only use whatever we needed.</br>
This is the list of objectives that we set out from the start with the help of our mentors:</br>

After we set our objectives and verified them with the company, we started the ETL process.</br>
The first step we did was draft a data warehouse model. We went through different possibilities until we settled for this one:</br>

After that we used Talend Studio to do the ETL process. You can see the ETL of each dimension and of the fact table in the main branch of this repository.</br>
Next step was the reporting phase with Power BI. We tried to use different graphs and illustrate the data in different ways and we ended up with these 5 pages: </br>

The next steps were to analyse the data with machine learning algorithms and export the power BI dashboard in a webpage.</br>
In the video titled "JIRA BI PROJECT" you can see a hole description of the webpage that contains the dashbord.</br>
As for the data analysis part you will find all the details in the report titled "PIBI-Final" where you'll also find more details about the whole project.</br>
Thank you for your time!
