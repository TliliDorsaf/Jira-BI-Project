# Jira-BI-Project
Jira-BI-project was a project proposed by Talys under agreement with Esprit university. 
Talys is a company that work with jira software but they were highly unsatisfied with the reports on jira's dashboards.
We used Talend, postgre and power BI to create a better dashboard to respond to their needs. 
We also used machine learning algorithms to further analyse the data we had in the data warehouse.
